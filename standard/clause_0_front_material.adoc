[big]*i.     Abstract*

The Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) rely on two characteristics of the TIFF v6 format (tiles and reduced resolution subfiles), GeoTIFF keys for georeference, and the HTTP range to allow for efficient downloading of parts of imagery and grid coverage data on the web and to make fast data visualization of TIFF of BigTIFF files and fast geospatial processing workflows possible.
COG aware applications can download only the information they need to visualize or process the data on the web. Numerous remote sensing datasets are available in cloud storage facilities that can benefit from optimized visualization and processing.
This standard formalizes the requirements for a TIFF file to become a COG file and for the HTTP server to make COG files fastly available on the web.

[big]*iii.   Preface*
COG was previously defined by a community of users with the intention of improving the distribution of remote sensing images on the cloud. This document respects the decisions taken and conventios addopted by the community and formalizes them in standard requirements and recommendations. The standard name still reflects this original purpose: a format optimized for the cloud. The similar principles are applied to other emerging formats such as Zarr (https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (https://copc.io/).

This document depends on the TIFF specification and the GeoTIFF standard. For big files, it may depend on the BigTIFF community standard. The standard takes advantage of some existing characteristics of the TIFF specification and the existing HTTP range specification and does not modify them in anyway.

[big]*iv.    Security Considerations*

COG has a requirements class that requires HTTP range. Attention has been made to allow also secure variants of HTTP such as HTTPS. Considerations to support Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) are done in the document. In particular, servers are encouraged to advertise the support for HTTP ranges in the Control-Allow-Headers header.

NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only allow various kinds of authentication under HTTPS. HTTPS only provides confidentiality or encryption at the protocol level. No confidentiality or encryption at the data level is provided at all.
