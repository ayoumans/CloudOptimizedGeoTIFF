== Media Types for any data encoding(s)
A GeoTIFF file is a TIFF file. It is common to use the tiff MIME  type, _image/tiff_ according  to [RFC3302] (see https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/image/tiff). The registration of the MIME type also allows for a _application_ with no format restriction for default value.
