== Overview
Traditionally, high resolution imagery over the web requires that big files have to be entirely downloaded to the client before they can be analyzed or visualized. In the past this files were provided by servers in the provider premises. Depending on the circumstances, this process can require some considerable download time thus preventing the creation of responsive real time applications. In addition, nowadays cloud services offers almost unlimited storage but the cost of the service depends on the intensity of use. The solution to this problems specified here is called Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) that is based on a particular usage of one of the most popular formats in the world: the TIFF format.

The TIFF format was created by the Aldus Corporation for use in desktop publishing. Aldus released the last version of the TIFF specification in 1992 (v. 6.0), subsequently only updated with an Adobe Systems copyright after the Adobe acquired Aldus in 1994. Several Aldus or Adobe technical notes have been published with minor extensions to the format, and several specifications have been based on TIFF 6.0, including TIFF/EP (ISO 12234-2), TIFF/IT (ISO 12639), TIFF-F (RFC 2306) and TIFF-FX (RFC 3949) and GeoTIFF (OGC 19-008r4, v1.1) and BigTIFF.

TIFF is a flexible, adaptable file format for handling images and data within a single file, by including the header tags (size, definition, image-data arrangement, applied image compression) defining the images. The ability to store image data in a lossless format makes a TIFF file a useful image archive. TIFF can be used to store grey scale, color or RGB images as well as integer of floating point data, making it ideal as a support for storing the rangeset of a 2D grid coverage data.

To improve TIFF performance over the web, COG relies on two characteristics of the TIFF v6 format, the georeference GeoTIFF keys and a HTTP relatively unused property. This way, COG allows for efficient downloading of parts of imagery and grid coverage data on the web, enables fast data visualization and facilitates faster geospatial processing workflows. This particular type of TIFF has been recently used to set up large series of remote sensing images on cloud providers repositories (e.g. Amazon Web Services) enabling cloud processing at lower traffic. In fact, COG-aware software can request just the portions of data that it needs, improving accessing time and bandwidth.

COG is based on the GeoTIFF standard and does not introduce new additional capabilities to the TIFF v6. As such, legacy software should be able to read COG files with no additional modifications. However, the legacy software will not be able to take advantage of the streaming (understood here as partial download) capabilities, but still can easily download the whole file and read it.

The amount of data available for geospatial analytics has increased considerably in recent years. Therefore, downloading the data into a single computer is often not feasible. Data producers that provide data in the COG format can help decrease how much data is downloaded and copied. This is because online software systems do not need to keep their own copy of the data for efficient access. New online software can access the content efficiently, while old version can still download the data completely. This avoids the need to have two copies of the file: one for fast access and another for download purposes.

COG relies on two complementary approaches already available in the existing standards to achieve its goal:

* The first is the ability of GeoTIFF to store the raw pixels of the image organized in an efficient way using tiles and overviews
* The second is HTTP GET Range request, that let web clients request just the portions of a file that they need.

Using the first approach, COG organizes the GeoTIFF so the latter requests can easily select and get the parts of the file that are useful for processing.

=== Efficient organization of data in a TIFF file
The Tiling and Reduced-Resolution Subfiles (sometimes called _overviews_) in the GeoTIFF format supports the necessary structure for COG files so that the HTTP GET Range queries can request just the part of the file that is relevant.

Reduced-Resolution Subfiles come into play when the client wants to render a quick image of the whole or a big part of the area represented in the file. Instead of downloading every pixel, the software can just request a smaller, already created, lower resolution version. The structure of the COG file on an HTTP Range supporting web server enables client software to easily find and download just the part of the whole file that is needed.

Tiles come into play when some small area of the overall extent of the COG file needs to be processed or visualized. This could be part of a reduced-resolution subfile, or it could be at full resolution. Tile organization makes all the relevant bytes of an area (a tile) to be in the same part of the file, so the software can use HTTP GET Range request to get only the tiles it needs.

=== Relation to OGC Tile Set Standards

The combined use of tiles and resolution levels is not new in OGC standards. In fact the OGC Two-dimensional Tile Matrix Set standard (and the older OGC WMTS 1.0) use exactly the same approach. However, the OGC API - Tiles standard and the older WMTS 1.0 standard require either a service to be installed in the web server provider or thousands of pre-generated independent files (one for each tile) to be created. None of this is necessary in the COG approach as most of the modern web services natively support HTTP range.
