|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/rec/rec-class-geotiff/ifd-order
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE}| In a COG file, and after the TIFF/BigTIFF header/signature and pointer to first IFD (and an eventual _ghost area_) sections SHOULD follow the following order:

1. IFD of the full resolution image, followed by TIFF tags values, excluding the TileOffsets and TileByteCounts arrays.

2. IFD of the mask of the full resolution image, if present, followed by TIFF tags values, excluding the TileOffsets and TileByteCounts arrays.

3. IFD of the first (largest in dimensions) overview level, if present

4. …

5. IFD of the last (smallest) overview level, if present

6. IFD of the first (largest in dimensions) overview level of the mask, if present

7. …

8. IFD of the last (smallest) overview level of the mask, if present TileOffsets and TileByteCounts arrays of the above IFDs

9. tile data of the smallest overview, if present (with each tile followed by the corresponding tile of mask data, if present), with leader and trailer bytes

10. …

11. tile data of the largest overview, if present (interleaved with mask data if present)

12. tile data of the full resolution image, if present (interleaved with corresponding mask data if present)
