== Scope
This document describes as an OGC standard how a TIFF files can be organized to extract convenient parts of the data at the needed resolution for visualization or analysis purposes. It also describe how to use HTTP (or HTTPS) to communicate only the part of information needed without downloading the complete file. This was previously defined by the community of users for remote sensing users of TIFF images on the cloud. that Finally it defines how a COG file contain metadata to describe the tiles as a TileSet based on a common Tile Matrix Set. This contribution is not in the COG format defined by the Remote Sensing community and was added by the OGC to integrate the COG format with the OGC 2 Dimensional Tile Matrix Set standard. This document depends on the TIF specification and the GeoTIFF standard. For big files, it depends on the BigTIFF community standard.
